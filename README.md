## Assignment Details

### Assignment 1: Install and Explore OpenGL (CO1)

Get started by setting up OpenGL and exploring its capabilities. This assignment serves as the foundation for the rest of the course.

### Assignment 2: Line Drawing Algorithms (CO2)

Implement DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithms to draw various types of lines using a mouse interface. Ensure compatibility with all slope values.

### Assignment 3: Circle Drawing Algorithm (CO2)

Implement the Bresenham circle drawing algorithm to draw objects in all quadrants with respect to the center and radius.

### Assignment 4: Polygon Filling Methods (CO4)

Implement flood fill/seed fill and boundary fill methods. Provide user interfaces for mouse clicks, keyboard input, and menu-driven programming.

### Assignment 5: Polygon Clipping (CO4)

Implement the Cohen Sutherland polygon clipping method to clip polygons with respect to viewport and window boundaries. Support both mouse click and keyboard input.

### Assignment 6: 2D Transformations (CO5)

Implement 2D transformations including scaling, rotation about an arbitrary point, and reflection with respect to an axis.

### Assignment 7: Fractal Patterns (CO5)

Generate fractal patterns using Bezier curves and the Koch Curve.

### Assignment 8: Animation Principles (CO6)

Apply animation principles to objects, exploring animation techniques in a graphics context.

## Getting Started

Each assignment folder contains detailed instructions and code samples to help you complete the tasks. Refer to the README file in each assignment directory for specific guidance.

## Support and Feedback

If you have questions or need assistance with any assignment, please reach out to your course instructor or teaching assistant. We encourage you to actively engage in the learning process and seek help when needed.

Happy coding and have a great learning experience!
